* Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

** Types of Machine Learning

*** Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Common examples include:
- Classification (predicting categories)
- Regression (predicting continuous values)

*** Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples:
- Clustering (grouping similar data points)
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection

*** Reinforcement Learning
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

* Popular Algorithms

** Neural Networks
Deep learning models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

** Decision Trees
Tree-like models that make decisions by splitting data based on feature values.

** Support Vector Machines
Algorithms that find optimal boundaries to separate different classes of data.

* Applications

Machine learning powers many modern technologies:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
