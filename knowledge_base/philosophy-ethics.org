* Classical Ethical Theories

** Virtue Ethics (Aristotelian)

Virtue ethics focuses on character rather than actions or consequences. Aristotle argued that virtues are habits of excellence that lead to human flourishing (eudaimonia).

*** The Golden Mean
Virtues often lie between extremes of excess and deficiency:
- Courage (between cowardice and recklessness)
- Generosity (between stinginess and wasteful spending)
- Honesty (between brutal truth-telling and deception)

** Deontological Ethics (Kantian)

Immanuel Kant proposed that moral actions are those performed from duty, guided by universal moral laws.

*** Categorical Imperative
"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."

This principle demands that we consider whether our actions could be universally applied without contradiction.

** Consequentialism and Utilitarianism

Actions are judged by their outcomes. The greatest good for the greatest number of people.

*** Mill's Harm Principle
"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."

* Modern Ethical Dilemmas

** Technology and Privacy

Digital surveillance raises questions about the balance between security and personal freedom.

** Environmental Ethics

Do we have moral obligations to future generations? How do we weigh economic development against environmental protection?

** Bioethics

Medical advances create new moral questions:
- Gene editing and human enhancement
- End-of-life care decisions
- Resource allocation in healthcare

* Applied Ethics in Daily Life

Ethical decision-making frameworks can guide us through complex personal and professional situations.

Consider multiple perspectives, examine consequences, and reflect on underlying principles.
